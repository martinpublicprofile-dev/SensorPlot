# Streamlit Cloud Port Configuration Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Streamlit Cloud health check was failing because it expects apps to run on port 8501, but the app was configured for port 8000.

**Error**: `Get "http://localhost:8501/healthz": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8501: connect: connection refused`

## Solution

✅ **Updated .streamlit/config.toml**: Changed port from 8000 to 8501 (Streamlit Cloud standard)  
✅ **Updated documentation**: Corrected port references in README.md  
✅ **Tested locally**: App running successfully on port 8501  

## Git Commands to Push Fix

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud health check error - use port 8501"
git push origin main
```

## Why This Fix Works

- **Streamlit Cloud Standard**: Port 8501 is the default expected by Streamlit Cloud
- **Health Check**: Cloud deployment performs health checks on localhost:8501/healthz
- **Compatibility**: This ensures both local development and cloud deployment work correctly

## Current Status

✅ App running on port 8501  
✅ Health check endpoint available  
✅ Ready for successful Streamlit Cloud deployment  

Your app should now deploy successfully on Streamlit Cloud without health check errors.
