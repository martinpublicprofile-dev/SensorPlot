# Git Commands to Push to GitHub

## Files Ready for Deployment

I've prepared all the files for Streamlit Cloud deployment. The requirements file has been renamed and everything is ready.

## Commands to Run

Copy and paste these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. Add all changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Prepare Streamlit app for cloud deployment

- Add streamlit_app.py as main entry point for Streamlit Cloud
- Update port configuration to 8000 for deployment  
- Add requirements.txt with all dependencies
- Update documentation with deployment instructions
- Add deployment guides and checklists
- Configure .streamlit/config.toml for cloud deployment"

# 4. Push to GitHub

## Alternative Single Command

If you prefer a single commit message:
