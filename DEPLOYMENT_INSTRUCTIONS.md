# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Instructions

## Files Created/Modified for Deployment

### 1. Entry Point: `streamlit_app.py`
- **Purpose**: Main entry point for Streamlit Cloud deployment
- **Content**: Imports and runs the main app function from `app.py`
- **Why**: Streamlit Cloud expects this naming convention

### 2. Configuration: `.streamlit/config.toml`
- **Changes**: Updated port from 8501 to 8000 as requested
- **Settings**: Optimized for cloud deployment (CORS disabled, headless mode)

### 3. Dependencies: `requirements_deployment.txt`
- **Content**: Lists all required packages for deployment
- **Note**: Rename to `requirements.txt` when pushing to GitHub for Streamlit Cloud

### 4. Documentation: Updated `README.md`
- **Added**: Specific Streamlit Cloud deployment instructions
- **Updated**: Local development commands to use `streamlit_app.py`

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare files**:
   ```bash
   # Rename requirements file for Streamlit Cloud
   mv requirements_deployment.txt requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Commit and push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Streamlit Cloud deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set main file: `streamlit_app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

## Why These Changes Were Made

### Port Change (8501 → 8000)
- **Reason**: You specifically requested port 8000
- **Impact**: Both local and cloud deployment will use port 8000

### Entry Point (`streamlit_app.py`)
- **Reason**: Standard Streamlit Cloud convention
- **Benefit**: Clear separation between development and deployment entry points

### Dependencies File
- **Reason**: Streamlit Cloud requires explicit dependency specification
- **Content**: Minimal set of required packages for optimal deployment

## Current Status

✅ **App successfully running on port 8000**
✅ **Entry point configured as streamlit_app.py**  
✅ **Dependencies documented for deployment**
✅ **Configuration optimized for Streamlit Cloud**

Your app is now ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment!
